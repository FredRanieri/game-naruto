![Screenshot](./imagem/intoDemo.png)

This game is a version of the gameboy game Pokemon, It's just the figth between Red and Green.

In one of my homework at University (2018) I worked in a version of the traditional gameboy game Pokemon using the language LUA. It was a homework of the Programming languages class.

### Compiled version

In this project, I used Love2D to compile my code and create a runnable. It's possible to run going to the folder `Compiled_Game` and click on the file `pokemon.exe`
